          Iâ€™m a final-year Computer Science Engineering student at E.G.S. Pillay Engineering College, passionate about Java development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and problem solving.

          I enjoy building scalable, full-stack applications using technologies like React, Java, and Tailwind CSS, always aiming for clean design and seamless user experience. Currently, Iâ€™m working on an AI-Driven Automated Penetration Testing Framework, combining intelligent automation with system security to enhance cybersecurity testing.

          Iâ€™m also experienced in cloud-based projects, including a mobile detection system built using Python and YOLOv8, which highlights my interest in AI and real-world applications.

          What drives me most is problem solving. I actively sharpen my skills on platforms like HackerRank and Skillrack, where I enjoy tackling algorithmic challenges that enhance my coding logic and analytical thinking.

          Iâ€™m a dedicated and curious learner, always exploring new technologies and striving to build efficient, secure, and user-friendly solutions. I'm actively seeking internship or full-time opportunities in software development where I can grow, contribute, and make a meaningful impact.
